# Intro

Sometimes all you really want is to launch a bunch of trained monkies
into the cloud.

Ham was the name of the first chimp NASA sent into space:

"ham" is a commandline tool for launching a one or more cloud servers on
an openstack cloud, running a bit of bash, and capturing the result.

    Usage: ham [options] <SCRIPT>

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -i IMAGE, --image=IMAGE
                            over-ride image
      -f FLAVOR, --flavor=FLAVOR
                            over-ride flavor
      -H HOSTNAME, --hostname=HOSTNAME
                            over-ride hostname
      -n COUNT, --count=COUNT
                            number of servers to build
      -p, --persist         servers built are permanent
      -d DISK, --disk=DISK  add some disks to server

# Installtion

    git clone; python setup.py install

ham depends on novaclient and fabric


# Volumes

ham has support to add volumes too, you can add the '-d' option
multiple times to define a set of volumes to be built for *each*
instance.

The format of the --disk param is:

    <size>[:volume_type]

* clone snapshot support coming soon

# Getting Started

Auth is handled by ENVIRONMENT VARS in a novaclient compatible way.

You'll want to source a novarc like file, e.g.

    export NOVA_VERSION="1.1"
    export NOVA_RAX_AUTH=1
    export OS_AUTH_URL=https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/
    export OS_TENANT_NAME=11111
    export OS_USERNAME=ham
    export OS_PASSWORD=bananas
    export OS_REGION_NAME=DFW

For your first test flight you might run something like:

    ham -d 100:SSD -n 2 example.script

Good Luck!
